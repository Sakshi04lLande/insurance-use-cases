## Insurance Use Cases

This repository contains a collection of **GenAI-powered insurance use cases** built to automate and simplify key insurance workflows.  
Each project focuses on a real-world insurance problem and demonstrates how **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **RAG pipelines**, and **vector databases** can be used in practical enterprise scenarios.

The projects are implemented as **independent tools**, mostly with **Streamlit-based web interfaces**, and are easy to run and understand.

## How to Set Up

### 1. Install dependencies
Each project has its own `requirements.txt`.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

### 2. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the root folder and add your API keys if required.

Example:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
```

---

## How to Run Any Project

1. Go to the project folder:

```bash
cd project-folder-name
```

2. (Optional but recommended) Create virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Each project also has its **own README** with more details.

## Technologies Used

* Python
* Streamlit
* Large Language Models (LLMs)
* Azure OpenAI / OpenAI API
* LangChain
* ChromaDB (Vector Database)
* RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
* PDF processing libraries

---

## Important Notes

* Each project works **independently**
* Vector databases are created only once where required
* `.env` and `venv` are excluded using `.gitignore`
* All paths are relative — run scripts from their project folders
